# URI-Online-Judge-Solutions
The URI Online Judge is a project that is being developed by the Computer Science Department of URI University. The main goal of the project is to provide programming practice and knowledge sharing. The URI Online Judge contains more than 1,000 problems divided in 8 big categories. This division help the users to focus on specific programming topics. All problems are available in Portuguese and English. The URI Online Judge website also has public contests on a regular basis.

Firstly, I want to point out a situation that I am not a pro-programmer! I'm adding these solutions for everyone including me, who wants to be benefited. These are my solutions for problems from URI Online Judge. I'll try to add more and solutions everyday. Also, I kept it open for all. So, you can obviously commit. Sometimes, as much I have experienced, we all need help to find solution of a particular problem. Also, sometimes we want to check other avialable solutions to find the most efficient one. So, each of your commit will help other programmers. Happy coding!
