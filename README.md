# URI-Online-Judge-Solutions
The URI Online Judge is a project that is being developed by the Computer Science Department of URI University. The main goal of the project is to provide programming practice and knowledge sharing. The URI Online Judge contains more than 1,000 problems divided in 8 big categories. This division help the users to focus on specific programming topics. All problems are available in Portuguese and English. The URI Online Judge website also has public contests on a regular basis.

Initially, I want to point out a situation that I am not a pro-programmer! I'm adding these solutions for everyone who wants to be benefited, including me! These are my solutions for problems from URI Online Judge. I'll try to add more and solutions gradually. Also, I kept it open for all. So, you can obviously commit or fork it out. Sometimes, as much I have experienced, we all need help to find solution of a particular problem or we want to check other avialable solutions to find the most efficient one. I am not saying that these are the most efficient solutions, but I hope these solutions will help you out in some way. Also, I'll be honored if you suggest another algorithm to solve a particular problem. So, each of your commit will help other programmers. Happy coding!
